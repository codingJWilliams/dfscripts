# Introduction #

Mainly used to make macros in the Windows environment. I am using it to create a macro program for DarkFall Online.


# Details #

  * Automate almost anything by sending keystrokes and mouse clicks. You can write a mouse or keyboard macro by hand or use the macro recorder.
  * Create hotkeys for keyboard, joystick, and mouse. Virtually any key, button, or combination can become a hotkey.
  * Expand abbreviations as you type them. For example, typing "btw" can automatically produce "by the way".
  * Create custom data-entry forms, user interfaces, and menu bars. See GUI for details.
  * Remap keys and buttons on your keyboard, joystick, and mouse.
  * Respond to signals from hand-held remote controls via the WinLIRC client script.
  * Run existing AutoIt v2 scripts and enhance them with new capabilities.
  * Convert any script into an EXE file that can be run on computers that don't have AutoHotkey installed.
